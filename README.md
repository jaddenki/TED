# T.E.D.
Game created in 3 days in Unity for Winter MelonJam 2023 following the theme of Charm.
Help the T.E.D. that we all love do his job so he doesn't get thrown out and replaced by another T.E.D.!

What does T.E.D. even stand for?

Maybe it stands for...
"Technological Employee Droid"
"Totally Expendable Droid"
"Technological Electromagnetic Droid"
"Totally Emotionally Devoid" 
"Technically Employable Droid"
"Tidy Electromachine Doctor"
"Too Economically Damaging"
"Terminator of Ecological Destruction" 
"Taco Enthusiast Droid"
"Trips Easily Droid"
"Tries Everything, Disastrously"
"Theodore Edwards Doyle"
"Task Execution Drone"
"Temporarily Employed Droid"
or maybeeee
"Task Efficent Droid"

We don't really know.
